    <h4>Dear <span class="person-addressed output"></span></h4>

  <p class ='indent'>
    I am submitting this Letter of application for the posted position of <span class='position output'></span>  along with an enclosed resume. I am very excited to enter into the field of Web Development and am looking to join a company where I can have meaningful contribution. I have a passion for working with technology, and over the past seven years that passion has only grown stronger as I have held various jobs that include smartphone repair, selling cell phones with T-Mobile wireless service, and becoming a web developer.
  </p>

  <p class ='indent'>
    One major aspect of Web Development that appeals to me is the endless amount there is to learn. The more I learn about it, the more I realize just how little I actually comprehend about it. To some people, that might seem daunting, but to me it’s exhilarating. I’m someone who looks at that and sees an endless amount of ways to improve my skill-set and help drive real business solutions with each increase in my overall knowledge. I have come to a point where I feel that I can make a contribution to a company that is solving some of these problems and I  hope to have an opportunity to do so. 
  </p>

  <p class ='indent'>
    My passion for technology has been alive since I was young, and it has driven me to learn and tinker with a lot of things. One of those things that helped clarify the direction I needed to go was a company I started called Family-Guard. It started as a project to help some Family Members, but became popular and grew. I remember being excited about the ideas that I had to improve the product by building dynamic features into it, but I didn’t have that skillet myself. So I sold the business and dove head first into the Bottega Bootcamp, where I learned how to develop those dynamic Web Applications.
  </p>

  <p class ='indent'>
    I believe my background and mindset around learning and improving allows me to be a great asset to <span class="company-name output"></span>. Being in sales taught me how to work with other people and to communicate effectively, repairing cell phones helped me learn and create processes to solve problems, and running my own business helped me to learn how to work independently, research my problems, troubleshoot multiple issues in a timely manner, and think critically to find a solution. I look forward to being able to tie those skills into the industry and bring my skills to the team at <span class="company-name output"></span>.
  </p>

  <p class="indent">
    I look forward to the opportunity to meet with you and interview for this position, so we can further discuss the position and the value I believe I will bring to <span class="company-name output"></span>. Thank you for your time and consideration. 
  </p>
   
   <p>
    Sincerely,
   </p>
