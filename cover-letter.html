    <p>
      I am submitting the enclosed resume for consideration of the Application Support Engineer position you have posted. I have been looking for a position of employment that I can meaningfully contribute to, with a company I hold in high esteem, and a career opportunity that will be fulling and full of advancements opportunities. I believe fulfilling the roll of Support Engineer fits these objectives. I have a passion for working with technology and over the past seven years that passion has only grown stronger as I have held various jobs that include smartphone repair, selling cell phones with T-Mobile wireless service, and becoming a web developer.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have had a passion for technology since I was young, and that passion has driven me to learn and tinker with a lot of things. The discovery of my passion for networking & programming came after I started my own company where I worked with routers, DNS, and other aspects of the OSI model. The project started out as a passion for the service I was providing which quickly evolved into the technology I was working with. After selling the business, I dove head first into the Bottega Bootcamp, where I learned how to develop Web Applications, got very familiar with the Unix/Linux command line, and started using and preferring to use the Ubuntu operating system.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe my background allows me to be a great asset to PrincePerelson & Associates. Being in sales taught me how to work with other people and to communicate effectively, repairing cell phones helped me learn and create processes to solve problems, and running my own business helped me to learn how to work independently, research my problems, troubleshoot multiple issues in a timely manner, and think critically to find a solution. I look forward to being able to tie those skills into the industry and bring my skills to the team at PrincePerelson & Associates I hope that you will consider me for this position.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am enthusiastic about exploring this employment opportunity with PrincePerelson & Associates. I look forward to the opportunity to meet with you and interview for this position, so we can further discuss the position and the value I believe I will bring to it and PrincePerelson & Associates. Thank you for your time and consideration. It would be an honor to work with a fast-growing company that helps innovators build a better world. If you have any questions, please call me at 385-209-4959. I look forward to hearing from you soon and meeting with you.
   </p>
